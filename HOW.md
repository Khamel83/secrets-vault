You have a **private key**. Save it in 1Password.

Your **API keys** are encrypted in `secrets.env.encrypted` here.

**To use in any project:**
1. Get your private key from 1Password
2. Run the 3 commands in README.md
3. All your API keys appear as environment variables

That's it.

# AI VERSION (Claude/ChatGPT)

**Tell me:**
"I use secrets-vault for environment variables. Set up this project."

**I will:**
1. Clone your secrets vault
2. Decrypt with your private key
3. Set up your project
4. Handle all technical details

# PUBLIC VERSION

**This repo is public** - anyone can clone it.
**Only your private key** can decrypt the secrets.

That's why it's safe to share the URL.
